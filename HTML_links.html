			The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.
			The link text is the part that will be visible to the reader. 
			Clicking on the link text, will send the reader to the specified URL address.

		<h1 style="text-align:center;"> Hey Morris!</h1>
		<h2 style="text-align:center;"> Da hani uf all Fäll mal paar sache wonni ide erste 5 täg glernt han zemmegnoh, enjoy (hopefullyxD) </h2>
		
		<p>When you click on the first link below, the link will be opened in the current browser window. If you don't want that to happen, you have to specify a target (that the developer of the webpage has to do, you as a user don't have to do this)</p>
		The target attribute can have one of the following values:<br>
		<ul><li>_self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked</li><br>
		<li>_blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab</li><br>
		<li>_parent - Opens the document in the parent frame</li><br>
		<li>_top - Opens the document in the full body of the window </li></ul></p>

		<!--No target specifyed, therefore the link will be opend in the same window (tab).-->
		<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant" >If you click on this link, the link will open in this window which you are in right now, hence this website will disapear. </a>

		<!--target specifyed to '_blank', therefore the link will be opend in a new window (tab).-->

		<p><a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant" target="_blank">If you click on this link, the link will open in another window and this website will still be open.</a></p>


		<!--
			By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:
			An unvisited link is underlined and blue
			A visited link is underlined and purple
			An active link is underlined and red 
		-->

		<!--
			Absolute URLs vs. Relative URLs
			Both examples above are using an absolute URL (a full web address) in the href attribute.
			A local link (a link to a page within the same website) is specified with a relative URL (without the "https://www" part): 
		-->

		<!--
			To use an image as a link, just put the <img> tag inside the <a> tag: First comes <a href="link i want the picture to show to" target="_blank"><img src="image that one can click on in order to get to the link specified before" 
		-->
		<p>The image below leads you to the wikipedia page on elephants, try click on it.</p>
		<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.wwf.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/social_share_image/public/2018-10/Large_WW1113482.jpg?itok=Bluh496C"style="width:300px;height:200px"></a>

		<!--
			Use mailto: inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program (to let them send a new email):
		 -->
		<p> <a href="mailto:janosch.buente1@yahoo.de">Send me (Janosch Bünte) an email!</a></p>

		<p title="Hi, I'm a tooltip. I appear because you hover your cursor over this paragraph">Put your cursor over this paragraph, the text the appears is called a tooltip.</p>

		<!--
			Button as a Link
			To use an HTML button as a link, you have to add some JavaScript code.
			JavaScript allows you to specify what happens at certain events, such as a click of a button: 
		-->
		<button onclick="C:\Users\buent\Documents\Dokumente HP Computer\Persönlich\Ausflüge">Hike Plan</button>
