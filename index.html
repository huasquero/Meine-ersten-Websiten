		A favicon is a small image displayed next to the page title in the browser tab. 
		How To Add a Favicon in HTML
		You can use any image you like as your favicon. You can also create your own favicon on sites like https://www.favicon.cc.

		Tip: A favicon is a small image, so it should be a simple image with high contrast.

		A favicon image is displayed to the left of the page title in the browser tab

		To add a favicon to your website, either save your favicon image to the root directory of your webserver, or create a folder in the root directory called images, and save your favicon image in this folder. A common name for a favicon image is "favicon.ico".

		Next, add a <link> element to your "index.html" file, after the <title> element
